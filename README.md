# Lighthouse Labs | Intro to SQL

* [ ] Databases
* [ ] PostgreSQL
* [ ] Basic SQL Queries

## How do we save so far?

* Local variables (object / array)
* Saving to files

### Pros

* Don't have to learn more than JS; just works!
* No 3rd-party structure or headache
* Lots of freedom
* Potentially a lot less code!
* Files are a persistant storage solution
* Great for quick and "dirty" tests

### Cons

* Space might be a concern depending on amount of data
* Structure requires a lot of thought / effort
* An outside language might have been nice to ensure separation of concerns (avoid collision)
* Might be less re-usable / shareable?
* JavaScript is not specialized in data storage...
    * Loss of efficiency; JS will struggle with organizing massive data
* Adds a lot of file / code bloat...
    * A lot more work keeping things organized, unwieldy.
* Read / write time for files will also be less efficient than a database system

## Databases

* Database Management Systems
    * Higher performance than trying to handle large sets of data in JS
    * They are specialized in efficient, consistent, and structured data reading/writing/etc.

### Relational Database Management Systems

Any DBMS that follows the relational model.

* PostgreSQL
* Microsoft SQL Server (MSSQL)
* MariaDB
* MySQL
* Oracle
